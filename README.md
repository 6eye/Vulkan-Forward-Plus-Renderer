## Milestones

### Milestone 3 (12/12/2016)
* (TODO:) Forward+ pipeline:
  * Compute pipeline
  * Shared descriptor sets for lights and camera to use compute pipeline output as fragment shader input.
    * Also used some push constants for the change of tile numbers after resizing window 
  * Light culling
  * Dive into depth :)

* Forward+ framework in progress:
  * Camera control
  * Point lights
  * Normal mapping
  * Blinn-Phong Shading

### Milestone 1 (11/21/2016)
* Basic Vulkan framework including:
  * basic forward rendering pipeline (adaptd from [Vulkan Tutorial by Alexander Overvoorde](https://vulkan-tutorial.com))
  * mesh
  * texture mapping
  * lambert shading

## How to Build

Use CMake to build the program.

#### Windows
1. Make sure you have Vulkan SDK and Visual Studio 2015 or up, then:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake-gui ..
```
2. And `Configure`(select `"Visual Studio 2015 x64"`), `Generate`, then you have Visual Studio project files.

3. Set `vfpr` as startup project and build solution


#### Linux
Make sure `VULKAN_SDK` is set to `x86_64` folder under Vulkan SDK path and you have `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and `VK_LAYER_PATH` set by running `source ./setup-env.sh` at Vulkan SDK folder, and then
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
